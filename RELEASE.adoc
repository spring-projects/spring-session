== 1. Update Dependencies

Dependencies are declared in `gradle/dependency-management.gradle`.
Update Spring Framework, Spring Security and Spring Data at a minimum.

Run all the checks:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew check
----

Create separate issues for each dependency update, aside from test dependencies which can be combined into a single commit.

== 2. Check All Issues are Closed

You can manually check at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/milestones

== 3. Update Release Version

Update the version number in `gradle.properties` for the release, for example `2.7.0-M1`, `2.7.0-RC1`, `2.7.3`

== 4. Update Antora Version

You will need to update the antora.yml version.

For milestone / release candidate releases you should follow this format:
----
version: '2.7.0-RC1'
prerelease: 'true'
display_version: '2.7.0-RC1'
----

== 5. Build Locally

Run the build using

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew check
----

== 6. Push the Release Commit

Push the commit and GitHub actions will build and deploy the artifacts.
Wait for the artifact to appear in https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/session/spring-session-core/

== 7. Tag the release

Tag the release and then push the tag

....
git tag 2.7.0-RC1
git push origin 2.7.0-RC1
....

== 8. Update to Next Development Version

Update `gradle.properties` version to next `+SNAPSHOT+` version, update antora.yml and then push

== 9. Update version on project pages

Update the versions on https://spring.io/projects for Spring Session Core, Spring Session Data Redis, Spring Session JDBC, Spring Session Hazelcast, and Spring Session MongoDB.

== 10. Update Release Notes on GitHub

Download
https://github.com/spring-io/github-changelog-generator/releases/latest[the
GitHub release notes generator]

* Generate the release notes

....
java -jar github-changelog-generator.jar \
    --changelog.repository=spring-projects/spring-session \
    $MILESTONE release-notes
....

Note 1: `+$MILESTONE+` is something like `+2.7.1+` or `+2.7.0-M1+`. +
Note 2: This will create a file on your filesystem
called `+release-notes+`.

* Copy the release notes to your clipboard (your mileage may vary with
the following command)

....
cat release-notes | xclip -selection clipboard
....

* Create the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/releases[release on
GitHub], associate it with the tag, and paste the generated notes.

== 11. Close / Create Milestone

* In
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/milestones[GitHub
Milestones], create a new milestone for the next release version.
* Move any open issues from the existing milestone you just released to
the new milestone.
* Close the milestone for the release.

Note: Spring Session typically releases only one milestone (M1) and one release candidate (RC1).

== 12. Announce the release

* Announce via Slack on https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/spring-session[#spring-session], and tag any downstream Spring Session projects (e.g Spring Session for Apache Geode).

Note: Do not post on #spring-release or create a blog post. Those steps happen after the Spring Session BOM is released.
